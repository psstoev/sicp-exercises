;; Exercise 2.46: A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin
;; to a point can be represented as a pair consisting of an
;; x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. Implement a data abstraction for
;; vectors by giving a constructor make-vect and corresponding
;; selectors xcor-vect and ycor-vect. In terms of your selectors and
;; constructor, implement procedures add-vect, sub-vect, and
;; scale-vect that perform the operations vector addition, vector
;; subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar:
;;
;; (x₁, y₁) + (x₂, y₂) = (x₁ + x₂, y₁ + y₂)
;; (x₁, y₁) − (x₂, y₂) = (x₁ − x₂, y₁ − y₂)
;;          s·(x, y) = (sx, sy)

;; Answer:
(define (make-vect x y) (cons x y))

(define (xcor-vect vect) (car vect))

(define (ycor-vect vect) (cdr vect))

(define (add-vect v1 v2)
  (make-vect (+ (xcor-vect v1)
                (xcor-vect v2))
             (+ (ycor-vect v1)
                (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (sub-vect v1 v2)
  (make-vect (- (xcor-vect v1)
                (xcor-vect v2))
             (- (ycor-vect v1)
                (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (scale-vect scalar vect)
    (make-vect (* scalar (xcor-vect vect))
               (* scalar (ycor-vect vect))))
