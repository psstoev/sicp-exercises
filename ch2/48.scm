;; Exercise 2.48: A directed line segment in the plane can be
;; represented as a pair of vectorsâ€”the vector running from the origin
;; to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running from the
;; origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector
;; representation from Exercise 2.46 to define a representation for
;; segments with a constructor make-segment and selectors
;; start-segment and end-segment.

;; Answer:
(define (make-segment start-point end-point) (cons start-point end-point))

(define (start-segment segment) (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment) (cdr segment))
