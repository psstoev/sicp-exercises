;; Exercise 2.2: Consider the problem of representing line segments in
;; a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a
;; starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor
;; make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment that
;; define the representation of segments in terms of points.
;; Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x
;; coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor
;; make-point and selectors x-point and y-point that define this
;; representation. Finally, using your selectors and constructors,
;; define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as
;; argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are
;; the average of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your
;; procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

;; Answer:
(define (make-segment start end) (cons start end))

(define (start-segment segment) (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment) (cdr segment))

(define (make-point x y) (cons x y))

(define (x-point point) (car point))

(define (y-point point) (cdr point))

(define (midpoint-segment segment)
  (make-point (average (x-point (start-segment segment))
                       (x-point (end-segment segment)))
              (average (y-point (start-segment segment))
                       (y-point (end-segment segment)))))

(define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))

;; test it:
(define p1 (make-point 1 1))
(define p2 (make-point 2 2))
(print-point (midpoint-segment (make-segment p1 p2)))
